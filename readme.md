# Lucky Weekend

A Minecraft datapack to give players the Luck effect when enabled.

## Why I made this datapack

This is a simple Minecraft datapack I made in a evening for my own server. 

I wanted my players to play more on weekends in order to coincide more often, so I had the idea is to give all players that log in in the weekends the Luck effect of level IV so they have an incentive to do so.


## How it works

This datapack is disabled by default. You have to run `/function luckyweekend:enable` to turn it on. To turn off, use `/function luckyweekend:disable`.

The best way to use this plugin is to use the [crontab from the linux server](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto) to automate enablig and disabling this datapack.
